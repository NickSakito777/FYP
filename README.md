This project explores the design and implementation of Campus Quest, a location-based
interactive exploration game powered by AI. The integration of map APIs, LLM-driven
task generation, and geofencing validation aims to enhance exploratory behavior and user
engagement in campus environments. The methodology combines front-end UI design,
backend task coordination, and multimodal verification techniques. The application is
developed in Java, utilizing the Baidu Map SDK and DeepSeek API, with system modules
such as task manager, photo verification, and real-time location tracking. This work
contributes a gamified framework for educational or orientation purposes, supported by
real-time AI interactions and spatial navigation.
